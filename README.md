# CS839-Blockchain-Project

### Brief
Private-file-sharing code on top of the p2b-blockchain code.
The logic is to do this in 3 steps: 1) share public keys, 2) share encrypted symmetric keys, 3) Share the files after encrypting them with the symmetric keys (Kind of similar to Diffie-Hellman, but taking a lot complexity out of it)

### Run
1. `chmod 777 script.sh`
2. `./script`
