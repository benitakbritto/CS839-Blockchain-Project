## Steps
- Share document for the first time by encrypting with own public key and putting encrypted file onto the blockchain
- At any subsequent time, only generate and share the re-encryption key to the proxy server using the particular receiver's public key + sender private key
- This can be replaced by putting the re-encryption key on the blockchain and the reference to the encrypted file on the blockchain - to make everything on-chain
